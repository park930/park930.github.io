# About Me
<br>

I am currently in the first year of my Masterâ€™s program in the [**Computer Science Department**](https://cs.korea.ac.kr/cs/index.do) at [**Korea University**](https://www.korea.ac.kr/sites/ko/index.do).

My research interests focus on **Image Compression** and **Neural Architecture Search**. <br><br>
I am grateful to receive guidance and advice from Professor [**Changhee Joo**](https://rain.korea.ac.kr/members/professor) at the [**RAIN Lab**](https://rain.korea.ac.kr/), which has been an incredibly valuable experience.

If you have any questions or would like to connect, feel free to reach out to me via [**email**](mailto:juhyunpark@korea.ac.kr).

Thank you for visiting!
